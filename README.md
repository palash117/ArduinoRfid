# GOJEK Parking lot project

My attempt as solving the gojek parking lot project

## Getting Started

As provided in the problem statement the project has been made with test driven development in mind.
The run script has been made to accept both terminal inputs and finle input.


### Installing

Proceed to the project directory and build using executing the build script


```
$ bin/setup
```


the script will also trigger the test cases as expected

## Running the tests

Running tests is part of the build process. The test cases include all the cases included in the sample input along with several corner cases to test the statbility of project

### Parking lot tests:



```
1)create parking lot test
2)Add vehicle to parking lot
3)Check registration number for cars with perticular colour
4)Check slot for cars parked with perticular colour
5)Check for car leaving parking lot
6)Check the slot for registration number

```
